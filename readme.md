## Expensify App

# About:
This responsive personal expenses tracker is a great way to keep eye on daily spendings. The ExpensifyApp allows users to log in via Google accout and check your last expenses from anywhere around the world and using any device with internet connection. The app offers to the user text and date filters and it also lets sort the expenses by date or by amount. The project was created to make me familiar with some ReactJS and Redux concepts.
